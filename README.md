Hey hey! These are the roles for the OAKHURST MAFIA in case you're wondering! 

# [[ GOOD TEAM || OAKHURST ]]
<sub> " Its not Vampires vs. Humans. Its Oakhurst vs. Those who wish to do us ill. „ -v!Legundo </sub>

> — Its beloved town has been plagued by all kinds of creatures of the night. The vampires arent going to make this light either.

The Citizens [INNOCENT] :; Stepping into the town of Oakhurst, you were curious about the whispers the town holds. Something about.. supernatural beings?

The Hunter [DETECTIVE] :; After getting labeled as 'Delusional' for convincing others that vampires are real on the FIRST DAY, You decided that its upon yourself to investigate a citizen.

The Doctor [MEDIC] :; You cannot save them all. Lose the arm, save the body. Lose the leg, save a life. You promised yourself to never harm another soul again. You can heal poison from other citizens through 'medicine', which is just a failed attempt of a cure for vampirism.

The Militia [JAILER] :; Formed by a former student at Oakhurst, its their job to keep the citizens of Oakhurst safe. How, you may ask? The Hunter made a cell for them to use! The Militia can Jail anyone for ONE NIGHT, blocking their actions.

The General [SOLDIER] :; A reason you were discharged from the military is because you cant handle blood, and in this town, Its nearly impossible to avoid it. You may attack a person who you think is a part of The Coven. Get it wrong, and fate may have to collect you the next day.

The Drift [SAVIOR] :; As a detective, they found this tome that allows the arts of necromancy. Could it be a gift from the gods? They have the ability to revive ONCE per player.

# [[ NEUTRAL TEAM || UNLABELED ]]
<sub> " When does a man become a monster? „ - Just a Man, E:TM </sub>

> — These civilians are not sure on who to side: so they decided to be an entirely seperate team. They cared for neither Oakhurst or The Coven. They are a team made up of them, themselves, and they.

The Butler [TRAITOR] :; Having been casted away from conversations, your glass of sanity shattered. You get to 'Foreshadow' how a player dies, and in ONE  night, that civilian dies! You can only do this THREE TIMES for the whole game.

Thou Cursed Mouth [WITCH] :; With thy tongue and thou cursed spells, thy witch can madde'th spells of concernity and stupidity, dont 'cha know? Thy death or thy poison isnt alloweth.

The Writer [CUPID] :; With some thinking and creativity, you can create FANFICTION of ANY  characters amd civilians! With this power, you can life-link these two civilians for eternity! Although this has a limit to TWO people. Any more than that and its just peak fanfic writing.

The Privileged [JESTER] :; My my, domt be fooled by their sweet tongue! Voting out this spoiled brat will be a very, //very// bad choice. The neutral team will automatically win! This however, does not apply if you killed the Jester In Game!

The Pearl [COOK] :; Their cooking is an absolute delight, especially with its ingredients being fresh from the source! They wanted to share their creation with their neighbors, but Do be wary! This food may or may not contain venom and quite possibly, werewolf blood .

The Sire [MAFIA] :; Having awoken from your 600 years of slumber to find your castle in ruins and wine gone, you decide to sink your fangs into this lovely town. Kill them, and the darkness shall follow it one after another.

The Lumberjack [ASSASSIN] :; 200 years of slumber right after having witnessed a 'friend' getting burned to the stake, you vowed revenge against those who done you wrong. They shall serve as the replacement of 'Sire' if Sire gets voted out, killed, or left. They can kill only up to FIVE TIMES.

The Scholar [CONSIGLIERE] :; Removed from your family will, you went to Oakhurst to prove yourself you are worthy. What isnt expected is that you became one of them. Your job? Disconnect/Clean the body from The Drift.
